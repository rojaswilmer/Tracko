App Create in Event Hack4Good
 
A cloud-based web application that attempts to find different sponsors for events organized by charity organizations. The web application will allow for participants to subscribe their interest using social media (through Hull.io) immediately showing the sponsors who is going to participate in the event.
Candidate sponsors would be notified of a new event, creating an easily and readily accessible platform for sponsors to find new and upcoming events, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the sponsorship of such events.
